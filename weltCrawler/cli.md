## Command Line Interface (CLI)

You know what a shell is, right?
Ever used tools like `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`?
They are programs, apps, commands .. you name it.

They don't have a graphical interface to click at.
They offer something else.
You do interact with these tools by using their specific interface!

1. What do you do when you have no idea of how to use a command?
    - How do do find out which software was installed using `brew`?
2. How do you find out which version of a tool is installed?
    - Which version of `node` do you have installed? And `npm`? And `java`?
3. Noticed any commonalities? Maybe there are some conventions regarding a CLI and how it's used?
    - Which commonalities do you see?
    - Copy the azubi-projects folder. Remove the copy afterwards. You will probably use `cp` and `rm` for that. What's the difference when using the `-v` parameter and when not? What does it do?
