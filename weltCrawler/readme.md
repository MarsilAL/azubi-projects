WeltCrawler
===========

__The student will implement a crawler application that parses rss feeds and provides an (secured) http API endpoint to consume the articles found.__

Goal of this project is to learn about software architecture, the java runtime / ecosystem and how to build and deploy a java backend application. The idea is to evolve the software from a small cli to a full fledged backend api running in the cloud.


Command line Interface (cli.md)
--------------------------------

Learn about the Terminal and start thinking about how your welt-crawler-cli would work for a user.

Java CLI App (javacli.md)
----------------------

Build a java cli app using gradle as a build system. 


Software building blocks (buildingblocks.md)
--------------------------------------------

Do you know about the onion architecture? Start thinking about responsibilities in your app. 

api (api.md)
------------

You cli is working. Time to make your app work in the web!

Serialization
-------------
