WeltCrawler
===========

__The student will implement a crawler application that parses rss feeds and provides a (secured) http API endpoint to consume the articles found.__

Goal of this project is to learn about software architecture, the java runtime / ecosystem and how to build and deploy a java backend application. The idea is to evolve the software from a small cli to a full fledged backend api running in the cloud.


Command line Interface (cli.md)
--------------------------------

Learn about the Terminal and start thinking about how your welt-crawler-cli would work for a user.


Java CLI App (javacli.md)
----------------------

Build a java cli app using gradle as a build system.


Software building blocks (buildingblocks.md)
--------------------------------------------

Do you know the onion architecture? Start thinking about responsibilities in your app. 


XML Parsing / Deserialization (deserialization.md)
--------------------------------------------

You stumbled accross XML and don't know how to handle that crap?
Go have a look into the Deserialization part of this project. Play the game and become first place!


api (api.md)
------------

You cli is working. Time to make your app work in the web!
