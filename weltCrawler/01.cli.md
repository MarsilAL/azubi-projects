## Command Line Interface (CLI)

You know what a shell is, right?
Ever used tools like mv, cp, rm, mkdir?
They are programs, apps, commands .. you name it.

They don't have a graphical interface to click at.
They offer something else.
You do interact with these tools by using their specific interface!
